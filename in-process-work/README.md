- Description: This is the sketch of the two figures that I drew. One figure is filled with Twitch emotes to represent the viewer and the other is filled with Twitch channels to represent the streamer.

After our group zoom meeting, I thought about how I could make the piece more specific to livestreaming and Twitch instead of it being a more general representation of online interactions. I tried to make the lines the exact color of purple that Twitch uses, but the node pattern still felt too general. As a result, I scrapped that idea and started working on making patterns of the most used Twitch emotes and most followed Twitch channels in order to make the focus more on livestreaming. I found those out by looking at https://stats.streamelements.com/ and https://twitchtracker.com/channels/most-followers.

I created the patterns in Adobe Photoshop and then masked them into the sketch of the figures.
