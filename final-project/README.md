- Date: April 29, 2020
- Medium: Digitally produced GIF
- Title: Virtual Connection, 14 x 18 inches
- Description: GIF of two figures with Twitch references on the inside

For my final work I made a GIF of some of the most used Twitch emotes and the top 10 Twitch channels with the most followers. I put the emotes and channel pictures inside of two figures that look like they are embracing. As my piece is about mental health in livestreaming, I thought about how I could convey that more than simply having the image of those Twitch elements. Movement was something that made the piece more dynamic and it relates to the movement of the chat, scenes, etc. of Twitch. The GIF is made in a way that makes it look like the figures are being emptied and then filled back up. In livestreaming, the chat is what makes the stream fun and enjoyable and it is also the thing that can be toxic and make the stream boring and sad at times. Hence, filling up and emptying. Since livestreaming is a digital, online, virtual phenomena, I found it fitting to have the piece also live digitally as a GIF.
